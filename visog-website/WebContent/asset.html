<h4 style="color:#333;">   Asset management:</h4>
                           <p> broadly defined, refers to any system that monitors and maintains things of value to an entity or group. It may apply to both tangible <a href="/wiki/Asset" title="Asset">assets</a> such as buildings and to intangible <a href="/wiki/Asset" title="Asset">assets</a> such as human capital, <a href="/wiki/Intellectual_property" title="Intellectual property">intellectual property</a>, and <a href="/wiki/Goodwill_(accounting)" title="Goodwill (accounting)">goodwill</a> and <a href="/wiki/Financial_assets" class="mw-redirect" title="Financial assets">financial assets</a>. Asset management is a systematic process of deploying, operating, maintaining, upgrading, and disposing of assets cost-effectively.</p>
<p>The term is most commonly used in the financial world to describe people and companies that manage investments on behalf of others. These include, for example, <a href="/wiki/Investment_management" title="Investment management">investment managers</a> that manage the assets of a <a href="/wiki/Pension_fund" title="Pension fund">pension fund</a>.</p>
<p>Alternative views of asset management in the engineering environment are: the practice of managing assets to achieve the greatest return (particularly useful for productive assets such as plant and equipment), and the process of monitoring and maintaining facilities systems, with the objective of providing the best possible service to users (appropriate for <a href="/wiki/Public_infrastructure" title="Public infrastructure">public infrastructure</a> assets).</p>
</p>
<h4  style="color:#333;">Mutual Fund</h4>>
<p>A mutual fund is one which is made up of money from lots of different individual investors, and then managed by a professional portfolio manager. Mutual funds invest in all the usual assets such as:

Bonds
Equities
Derivatives
The amount an investor gains or loses in the fund is directly proportional to the amount they invest into the fund. Mutual funds typically have a target level of return and usually charge a management fee of 1-2% per annum.</p>
<h4>Investment Bank (IB)</h4>
                               <p>Investment banking comprises 3 main areas: investment banking division (IBD), sales and trading (S&T), and asset management. The large global banks typically offer all 3 services, with smaller banks usually focusing more on the investment banking division side covering advisory and mergers and acquisitions (M&A).

What Is Investment Banking

The investment banking division is sometimes referred to as corporate finance and is broadly split into 2 sectors, products and industries. The purpose of both is to provide advisory on transactions, mergers and acquisitions and to arrange (and sometimes even provide) financing for these transactions. This area of banking is the subject of the popular book "Monkey Business: Swinging Through the Wall Street Jungle".</p>

<h4>Products comprise the following types of deals:</h4>

<p>Mergers and Acquisitions (M&A) - advisory on sale, merger and purchase of companies</br>
<p>Leveraged Finance (LevFin) - lending money to firms to finance acquisitions</br>
<p>Equity Capital Markets (ECM) - advice on equity and equity-derived products (shares, options, futures etc)</br>
<p>Debt Capital Markets (DCM) - advice on raising and structuring of debt to finance acquisitions</br></p>


<p>Restructuring - improving the structures of a company to make it more profitable or efficient
Industry groups focus on one specific industry (Technology & Media & Telecoms, Financial Institutions, Energy etc) but carry out all the different kinds of deals for firms within that sector. For example, the Financial Institutions (FIG) team will work with clients on raising debt, IPOs, acquisitions etc, but will only work with clients within that sector.

Some firms are known for being particularly good at certain sectors, for example Goldman Sachs TMT (Technology, Media & Telecoms), Morgan Stanley M&A, and JPMorgan LevFin.

<h4>Hierarchy and Compensation</h4>

<p>The hierarchy within the investment banking division is very well defined. The actual role names may differ from region to region and bank to bank, but all follow the same general pattern.</p>

<h4>Analyst:</h4>     
                 <p>this is how you will enter banking once you have completed your degree. The usual way to be offered a place is to complete an internship with the bank at the end of your junior year at school and then to receive a full time offer to come back at the end of your final year, although it is also possible to apply directly for a full-time job. Typically the analyst does all the 'grunt' work on projects such as valuing companies, creating models, putting together pitch books etc. Analysts are well known for working 80-100 hours per week but are well paid for it.</p>

<h4>Associate:</h4>
<p>if you have been working in finance for several years and/or gone to a business school for an MBA, you can break into investment banking as an associate. It is also possible to be promoted to associate directly from analyst level if you stay on with the bank for a 3rd year as an analyst. Your work as an associate will be focused on co-ordinating the work of the analysts to meet the expectations of the vice president. Associates tend to work as much as or slightly less than analysts, but are paid more for it.</p>

<h4>Vice President:</h4> 
             <p>vice presidents are where the managerial work starts to kick in. Your role is to make sure that the work your analysts and associates produce is what your senior vice president and managing directors want. There is a lot of client interaction and the work becomes more client relationship orientated. At some firms this position is called 'Director'.</p>

<h4>Senior Vice President</h4>  
                   <p>this is basically a mixture between vice president and managing director. The focus is both on executing deals and client relationships and what you actually do will depend on the needs of the group at the time. Also known as 'Executive Director'.</p>

<h4>Managing Director</h4> 
              <p>MD is the highest level you can achieve within a bank without becoming a group head or higher (CEO, CFO etc). Almost all of an MD's time is spent on client relationships and sourcing new clients.</p>

<h4>Bulge Bracket vs Boutique:</h4>

               <p> Many different companies are referred to as being investment banks, and they are usually segmented according to their revenue, size or global presence. The 9 largest banks are called the 'bulge bracket' and all other banks are called 'boutiques'. Bulge bracket banks tend to offer every service listed above whilst boutiques tend to focus on advisory roles and sometimes provide asset management.</p>

<p>Currently, the bulge bracket consists of the following banks:</p>

<p>Bank of America Merrill Lynch (BAML)</br>
<p>Barclays Capital (BarCap)</br>  
<p>Citigroup (Citi)</br>  
<p>Credit Suisse (CS)</br>  
<p>Deutsche Bank (DB)</br>  
<p>Goldman Sachs (GS or Goldman)</br>
<p>JPMorgan Chase (JPM)</br>   
<p>Morgan Stanley (MS)</p></br>
<p>UBS</br></p>
     <p>Boutique investment banks can range in size from reasonably large, global firms to tiny 10-man firms. Below is a list of some of the larger and more well-known boutique investment banks:</p>

      <p>Evercore</br>
      <p>Jefferies & Co</br>
      <p>Lazard</br>
      <p>Moelis</br>
      <p>Piper Jaffray</br>
      <p>Qatalyst Partners</br></p>

<h4 style="color:#333;">  Enterprise asset management :</h4>
          <p>Enterprise asset management is the business of processing and enabling information systems that support management of an organization's assets, both physical assets, called "tangible", and non-physical, "intangible" assets.

Physical asset management: the practice of managing the entire lifecycle (design, construction, commissioning, operating, maintaining, repairing, modifying, replacing and decommissioning/disposal) of physical and infrastructure assets such as structures, production and service plant, power, water and waste treatment facilities, distribution networks, transport systems, buildings and other physical assets. It is related to asset health management.
Infrastructure asset management expands on this theme in relation primarily to public sector, utilities, property and transport systems. Additionally, Asset Management can refer to shaping the future interfaces amongst the human, built, and natural environments through collaborative and evidence-based decision processes
Fixed assets management: an accounting process that seeks to track fixed assets for the purposes of financial accounting
IT asset management: the set of business practices that join financial, contractual and inventory functions to support life cycle management and strategic decision making for the IT environment. This is also one of the processes defined within IT service management
Digital asset management: a form of electronic media content management that includes digital assets</p>
 
<h4 style="color:#333;"> Public asset management:</h4>

             <p>Unbalanced scales.svg	The neutrality of this section is disputed. Relevant discussion may be found on the talk page. Please do not remove this message until conditions to do so are met. (April 2014) (Learn how and when to remove this template message)
Public asset management, also called corporate asset management, expands the definition of enterprise asset management (EAM) by incorporating the management of all things of value to a municipal jurisdiction and its citizens' expectations. An example in which public asset management is used is land-use development and planning.

An EAM requires an asset registry (inventory of assets and their attributes) combined with a computerized maintenance management system (CMMS). All public assets are interconnected and share proximity, possible through the use of geographic information systems (GIS).

A GIS-centric public asset management standardizes data and allows interoperability, providing users the capability to reuse, coordinate, and share information in an efficient and effective manner by making the GIS geo-database the asset registry. A GIS platform combined with information of both the "hard" and "soft" assets helps to remove the traditional silos of structured municipal functions. While the hard assets are the typical physical assets or infrastructure assets, the soft assets of a municipality includes permits, license, code enforcement, right-of-ways and other land-focused work activities.

The GIS platform is only an assisting tool; asset managers need to make informed decisions about their assets in order to fulfill their organizational goals. While geospatially displayed information can assist in decision-making, the deep understanding of markets, engineering systems, and human interaction enabled by analysis and synthesis of information not found in GIS systems is also present.</p>
