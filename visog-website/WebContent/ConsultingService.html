Transformation Delivery Method

Solutions we Offer

TCS Transformation Delivery Method ensures the quality, consistency, and certainty of outcomes in the execution of programs and projects. With our method and associated reusable assets, we offer an enhanced experience throughout the transformation lifecycle by delivering business results, providing leadership to drive the transformation, and partnering for success. 

We support four approaches:


Iterative: Activities are broken down into smaller batch sizes with the Design, Build, and Test phases repeated in cycles or iterations. With each iteration, additional features can be designed, developed, and tested until the fully functional software application is ready.
Traditional SDLC: This approach is sequential in which progress is seen as flowing steadily downwards. Each phase represents a distinct stage of development and is completed before the next one can begin, with stage gate milestones that must be met to move forward.
Agile (Scrum): This is an iterative and incremental approach. The Scrum lifecycle begins with a Product Backlog that is used during Sprint Planning to identify features and work for the team to accomplish during a specific Sprint. A Sprint has a duration of 2 – 4 weeks, resulting in a useable and potentially releasable product increment.
Scaled Agile Framework: SAFe is an online, freely revealed knowledge base of proven success patterns for implementing Lean-Agile software and systems development at enterprise scale. It provides comprehensive guidance for work at the enterprise portfolio, value stream, program, and team levels.
